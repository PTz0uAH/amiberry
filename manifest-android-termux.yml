  Description: |-
   amiberry v7.0.0 Optimized Commodore Amiga emulator for Termux
    .
    Amiberry is based on the latest WinUAE, with several features on top of it,
    like WHDLoad booter, custom controls, Host-Run functionality and more.
    .
    Amiberry needs Kickstart-rom and Amiga Operating System to boot.
    Kickstart nor OS are included, the user has to provide those files themself.
    If one has no Amiga-rom the build-in Aros-rom will be used.
    The Aros-rom is a free Amiga-rom replacement also used to boot Aros-OS.
    The Aros-rom works with a lot of oldskool Amiga demos and games.
    For serious applications and modern Workbench you must use an Amiga-rom.
    .
    Amiberry for Termux-non-root was 100 percent created on-device.
    The program runs best on fast android device with plenty memory!
    .
    Have tons of fun!
    .
    With kind regards
    PTz(Peter)uAH
