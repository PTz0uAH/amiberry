  Description: |-
   amiberry v7.0.0 Optimized Commodore Amiga emulator for Termux
    .
    The emulator needs Kickstart-rom and Amiga Operating System to boot.
    Kickstart nor OS are included, the user has to provide those files themself.
    If you have no Amiga-rom you can use the build-in Aros-rom.
    The Aros-rom is a free Amiga-rom replacement also used to boot Aros-OS.
    The Aros-rom works with a lot of oldskool Amiga demos and games.
    For serious applications and modern Workbench you must use Amiga-roms.
    .
    Amiberry for Termux-non-root was 100 percent created on-device!
    .
    Have tons of fun!
    .
    With kind regards
    PTz(Peter)uAH
